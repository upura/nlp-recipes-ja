# Morphological Analysis

This folder contains examples for morphological analysis.

Konoha is a Python library for providing integrated interface of various Japanese tokenziers, which enables us to switch tokenizers. We can use MeCab, KyTea, Janome, Sudachi, Sentencepiece, and nagisa. Konoha doesn't support the function of filtering some nouns. We can use pure nagisa for this purpose.
